### Exploring Maslow’s Hierarchy of through interactive housing visualizations

David Hacker | Ethan McFarlin | James Parker

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a psychological model that maps out tiers of human needs on the basis of psychology, safety, love, esteem, and other factors. 

It is particularly interesting that housing touches all levels of Maslow’s hierarchy from providing basic physical shelter to creating a medium for artistic expression.

Our goal for this project is to explore Maslow’s hierarchy in the lens of housing visualizations. This topic provided the opportunity to create a diverse portfolio of visualizations that illustrate trends such as relocation, entertainment, home physical characteristics, etc. Our visualizations will be exploratory in nature and allow homebuyers to identify insights like housing hot spots, notable mansions, and geographic housing trends.

There's no place like home.
