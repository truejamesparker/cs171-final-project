### Exploring Maslow’s Hierarchy of through interactive housing visualizations

David Hacker | Ethan McFarlin | James Parker

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a psychological model that maps out tiers of human needs on the basis of five fundamental
factors:
1. Physiological
2. Safety
3. Love
4. Esteem
5. Self-actualization

Housing touches **all** levels of Maslow's Heirarchy. From basic physical shelter to a medium for artistic expression,
our housing plays a significant role in how we experience life, interact with others, and even feel about ourselves.

Our goal for this project is to explore Maslow’s Hierarchy through the lens of housing using interactive data 
visualizations. This project provided the opportunity to create a diverse portfolio of visualizations that illustrate
trends in relocation, entertainment, celebrity mansions, housing's physical characteristics, etc.

Given housing's significance to the human experience, it's more important than ever to promote policy, technology, and 
organizations that seek to make quality housing and home-ownership more accessible to everyone.

Afterall, there’s no place like home.
